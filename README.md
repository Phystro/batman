**Batman** is a convenience utility tool that monitors the battery's energy consumption and usage while displaying notifications alerts to the user in response to changing battery states e.g. charging, discharging, battery absence, low charge capacity e.t.c.

In Linux, on installation, the tool will thereafter always automatically start during the startup of the user's desktop environment after the user has logged in.

The Linux Batman incooporates a small daemon called `batmand` that collects and analyses various power supply parameters. Batmand runs
as root and can also be controlled using systemctl commands.

Currently supported in Linux and Windows based systems.
